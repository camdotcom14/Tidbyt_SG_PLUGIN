# Tidbyt_SG_PLUGIN
A plugin for ShotGrid Events Daemon that links to a Tidbyt device

- To be added to a plugins folder in shotgrid events daemon
- CNVs for my use means "Check New Versions" and the number changes according number of Versions with status CNV.
- All files must live in the plugins folder in order for this to work.
- listen_for_cnv_versions_example.py does exactly that, and triggers the SG_DATA_EXAMPLE.py
- SG_DATA_EXAMPLE.py creates the Starlark files required for Tidbyt - Documentation here: https://tidbyt.com/blogs/tidbyt/building-a-pixel-art-bitcoin-tracker
- FEEDBACK WELCOME! THANKS!
