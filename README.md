# Tidbyt_SG_PLUGIN
A plugin for ShotGrid Events Daemon that links to a Tidbyt device

- To be added to a plugins folder in shotgrid events daemon
- CNVs for my use means "Check New Versions" and the number changes according number of Versions with status CNV.
- All files must live in the plugins folder in order for this to work.
- SG_DATA_EXAMPLE.py creates the Starlark file required for Tidbyt
- FEEDBACK WELCOME! THANKS!
